How a Flat White Sparked My MVP Journey

Years of branding experience. A thousand client campaigns.
But one quiet Thursday, a question caught me off guard:

“What if I built something of my own?”

That day at a small café in Abuja, I sketched the seed of what would become The Seed Room—a boutique space to help early founders bring clarity to their ideas and soft-launch with confidence.

Not a design studio.
Not a startup accelerator.
Something gentler. More intentional.

A place where ideas grow roots.

That spark became my MVP.
And this is Chapter 1 of my journey—from idea to impact.

I’ll be sharing the next 9 chapters over the coming days, walking through every messy, magical step.

To every entrepreneur sitting on an idea, wondering if it’s “enough” to start: it is.
Start where you are. You’re not alone.

Question to end with:
Have you ever felt a quiet nudge to build something of your own?

Drop a “Yes” if you want to follow the full story—and maybe even start your own.
